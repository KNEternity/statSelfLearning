Linear regression 
    -for predicting quantitative values

Notation
    n
        -number of distinct data points
    p
        -number of variables that are available for use 

    example
        11 variables for 3000 people
        n = 3000
        p = 11 


2.1: What is stastical learning?

Y = f(x) + e 

y = response or dependent variables

x = predictors, indpendent variable, features, or just variable 

e = random error term

2.1.1: why estimate f? 

Prediction
    In many situation, inputs X are available, but not the output Y 

    predicty Y using an estimation function 

    Reducible error 
        an error we can improve the acuracy of f

    Irreducible error
        cannot reduce the error introduced by E
